## datapulp Portfolio Site Template (WIP)

`A simple portfolio site. No frills, no js.`

### Overview:
A simple Portfolio/Profile website modified to suit my needs of further simplicity...
Some might say, 'too simple'. <br/>

### In future:

Achieve branch releases:
1. dev branch (Master) to first release stage
1. server prep
1. server config
1. servers. Vagrant? (etc.)

This will probably take longer than it seems.
