This is the original sav clone, cloned on 28/08/2020.

There's not much to it but it is clean and nice, and will be the starting point for the template. <br/>
Maybe you are here because you want to work backwards from what you see in the 'final dev' or 'template'.

## datapulp Portfolio Site Template (WIP)

`A simple portfolio site. No frills, no js.`

### Overview:
A simple Portfolio/Profile website modified to suit my needs of further simplicity...
Some might say, 'too simple'. <br/>

### In future:

Create 3 branches
1. saviokay clone
1. template branch (barebones starting point)
1. my dev branch _for everyone else to see_ o.O
